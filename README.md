## A News Website.

A website which collates data on various hot topics from around the world. This was created using Django and provides news from India, Worldwide, Science & Technology, Sports etc.
It also features a statistic board displaying COVID19 cases on the homepage.

I have used BeautifulSoup module for the extraction of live counts of COVID19 cases. And for the template, I have created a replica of Google Chrome's homepage.

### Steps to run the project:
* Open the CMD prompt.
* Set the path of Django folder in CMD prompt.
* Run this line of code to CMD prompt - python manage.py runserver
* Copy the htttp link from the CMD prompt and paste it in the browser.
